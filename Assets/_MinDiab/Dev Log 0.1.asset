  shortDescription: "When giving an attack command the player should attack immediately\t"
  longDescription: '1. Click to attack with the bow on an AI  out of range

    2.
    Player seems to do a cooldown before attacking


    ## Analysis

    The character
    seems to go into the attack animation but comes out of the animation before they
    fire.


    The animation will exit if stopAnimation is triggered. Is the previous
    action being stopped after the attack animation has been started?

  longDescription: '1. Start game in Main with no save game

    2. Pickup the bow

    3.
    Click to attack the grunt with fists (left hand guard)

    4. Many times will
    start shooting the Archter (on the right)


    ## Analysis


    Are we ever
    setting Fighter.combatTarget to the Archer? Yes, we do

    from a Cinemachine camera requires that the raycast happen in the same update
    as the Cinemachine upadage (LateUpdate). I just removed Cinemachine for now.'
